# COVID Death Vaccination - SQL Report

## üìö Overview:

This Project provides SQL queries for analysing CovidDeaths.csv and CovidVaccinations.csv Dataset from 01-01-2020 to 04-30-2021 focusing on trends and insights for the different Countries, Continents.
It is a SQL Data Exploration Project where I used data cleaning and filteration to get the desired datasets and then wrote SQL queries to draw insights from the dataset.

Here is a quick snapshot of the two datasets for COVID Deaths and Vaccinations used:

### COVID Vaccinations Dataset Snapshot:

## ‚úèÔ∏è Data cleaning:

- Changed Data types for columns that were incorrectly added in the dataset
- eg. Changed decimal values to Float where it was INT, VARCHAR(1) to VARACHAR(20) if it needed more characters
- Arranged the columns by ordering other columns according to use
- Hid columns not required for the dataset for faster access of columns that were required
- Changed names of columns to a better name so it was accurate to understand
  


## This COVID SQL report covers differet scenarios like:
- Finding Total COVID cases, deaths 'continent'/'country' wise
- Comapring Total Deaths, Total cases, Death percentage for Population
- Highest Infection Rate per Country/Continent for Population
- People fully Vaccinated RATE acc. to Population Country/Region wise
- Highest Number of Cases, Deaths, Vaccinations each Continent Month-wise for a Year
- Using ROW_NUMBER(), CTE, Showing the Country details grouped by highest number of Death cases

## üí° Conclusion

This is a SQL Exploratory Anasysis for analysing countries or continents to know more about their population, deaths due to COVID, vaccinations people got for COVID in each region. It gives insights into the COVID virus happenings for the year 2020, 2021. By writing SQL queries, we can know the insights and get a report of all the different scenarios and conditions for COVID.
